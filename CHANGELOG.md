# Changelog

All notable changes to Supacharger Core will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Note for contributors and agents:** This file documents **Supacharger Core**, maintained automatically by agents acting for **Core contributors**, including contributors working in Core forks. Application developers using Supacharger record their own changes in [CHANGELOG.project.md](CHANGELOG.project.md). Humans should request updates through an agent rather than edit this file manually. Agents may change it only following a human request to update Core release notes (including “do the changelog”) or commit Core changes. An ordinary application commit does not authorise a Core changelog edit; a changelog request alone does not authorise committing or publishing. A Core update may copy upstream release notes unchanged without authoring new entries. Follow Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 and the installed contributor policy and writing skill.

> Install the optional [Core contributor instructions](https://github.com/glowplug-studio/supacharger-development-agents.md) at `.agents/supacharger/core-development/`: use `git submodule update --init .agents/supacharger/core-development` when already registered, or `git submodule add git@github.com:glowplug-studio/supacharger-development-agents.md.git .agents/supacharger/core-development` otherwise. Install the writer with `supacharger skills install general/changelog`. See [Contributing to Supacharger](https://supacharger.dev/docs/contributing) for setup and triggers, and [Agent guidance](https://supacharger.dev/docs/agents) for instruction ownership and technical references.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Free public agent skill installation with checkbox selection, named installs, pinned Git revisions and explicit updates that preserve local customisations. The canonical installer is distributed through the Supacharger CLI separately from paid modules.
- Separate application instructions, technical references and optional Core contributor guidance, with documented installation and a reusable changelog-writing skill.
- A developer-owned application changelog alongside contributor-maintained Core release notes.

### Changed

- Core updates preserve project instructions and installed skills; shared agent guidance and Core release notes have explicit ownership.
